# BlockTest
This is the first attempt at doing a Gear VR Game in Unity

## Description
This is the first program I am doing in Unity3d for the Gear VR. I am using this mostly to test all the different things that we can do and try to create a full game at the same time. A lot of this is going to be things that others have already done (such as the breaking bricks thing) but it was a great opportunity to try out all the pieces of a game and what works inside of the Gear VR / Oculus vs what you can do on a regular Unity3d game.

## Version Notes

### 1.0.0
Initial Git push. This has the game set up and running in Gear VR. All the settings and what not have been set and there are a LOT of assets that aren't used in the application due to bringing in things to test and trying out various things from other games as an attempt to learn!

I have created a wall of bricks and the shooter (shooting from the camera in the direction the user is looking by tapping the track pad on the Gear VR.) It also has a UI that tracks the number of shots and the bricks broken. 

## Things to be done or thinking out loud

- Change UI to be 3D in the world so you have to look at it to see it rather than being attached to the camera as it is in V1

- Add a cannon under the camera to shoot from rather then from the center of the cannon (will allow me to test meshes in Unity from Blender as well)
